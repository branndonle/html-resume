    <h3><a href="https://github.com/branndonle/LostNights">Lost Nights</a></h3>
        <em>Georgia Tech (GT) Video Game Design</em>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a horror game by utilizing the Unity Software</li>
        <li>Implemented character design and game functionality, such as interactions with objects in the surrounding environment, and pioneered an NPC AI that trails the player within a maze on a NavMesh using C#</li>
        <li>Incorporated C# that aided in developing and designing canvases and interfaces aesthetically for scenes, such as the main menu, pause scene, and victory/defeat scene</li>
        <li>Developed C# scripts that allowed players to modify the game by pausing, interact with the surrounding  environment, defeat screen, victory screen, and main menu scenes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://github.gatech.edu/VIP-Finance/StatisticalForecasting">AI-based Discovery and Innovation (Statistical Forecasting)</a></h3> 
        <em>Georgia Tech (GT) Virtually-Integrated-Projects</em>
    <ul>
        <li>Constructed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that forecasts the prices of stocks granted by yfinance from prior years based on the opening/closing of the market</li>
        <li>Allocated data using python and pandas, integrated training and testing datasets using numpy, in an effort to parameterize the data in various functions that achieved the maximum accuracy rate</li>
        <li>Enhanced the deep-learning process by centralizing keras and fabricated activation functions that allowed us to achieve a 3% increase in validity</li>
        <li>Calculated mathematical operations, portrayed datasets and manipulated numpy arrays to forecast stock prices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/NokSamLeong/ML-Accent-Categorization">Accent Categorization</a></h3>
    <em>Georgia Tech (GT) Machine Learning</em>
    <ul>
        <li>Applied clustering algorithms, a GMM model, and a 13-layer Neural Network to classify which region of the United States a person originates from based on their dialect, acquiring a 61% accuracy</li>
        <li>Processed data, handled the version control with git, in which that allowed fellow developers to collaborate synchronously</li>
        <li>Extracted and converted data into .wav files to obtain the dataset, establish ground truth, and assign regions to clustering algorithms by employing Python libraries to retrieve the purity</li>
        <li>Utilized numpy to produce the sum, normalized the pairwise distance value, conducted matrix multiplication between arrays, extracted data and converted to numpy arrays</li>
        <li>Effectively mentored fellow collaborators to communicate and participate in meeting</li>
    </ul>
